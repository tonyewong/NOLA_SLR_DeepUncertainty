This repository contains the BRICK model source code and analysis scripts.

It contains the sub-models
- DOECLIM (climate)
- DAIS (Antarctic ice sheet)
- SIMPLE (Greenland ice sheet)
- GSIC-MAGICC (Glaciers and small ice caps)
- TE (thermal expansion)
- GMSL (Rahmstorf 2007, global mean sea level emulator)
- Van Dantzig flood risk assessment (Van Dantzig, 1956)

================================================================================

Workflow:

--> Create the dynamic libraries necessary to run the model in Fortran.
--> Directions on “make”-ing the file is found at /fortran/README

./calibration/BRICK_calib_driver.R
--> calibrate the DOECLIM+SIMPLE+GSIC+TE parameters using modern data

./calibration/DAIS_calib_driver.R
--> calibrate the DAIS parameters using paleoclimate data

./calibration/BRICK_calib_driver_R07.R
--> calibrate Global sea-level rise parameters using modern data and the Rahmstorf 2007 model

./calibration/BRICK_calib_driver_SIMPLE-GSIC.R
--> calibrate the SIMPLE-GSIC parameters using modern data

./calibration/processingPipeline_BRICKexperiments.R
--> combine modern and paleo calibration parameters, and calibrate the joint set
    to sea level data using rejection sampling
--> make hindcasts and projections of sea level
--> project local sea level and assess flood risks
--> NOTE: files names must be edited to point to the correct files.
—-> Run control: set experiments to c
—-> Run w/ SIMPLE-GSIC: set experiments to e
—-> Run R07: set experiments to g

./calibration/analysis_and_plots_BRICKexperiments.R
--> create plots and analysis for the Wong, Bakker et al (2016) figures
--> NOTE: files names must be edited to point to the correct files.

Note that in each of these scripts, some edits will be necessary. These will
include pointing at the proper file names. The BRICK and DAIS calibration driver
scripts produce calibrated parameter files with date-stamps in their names. You
will need to make sure the processing pipeline script points at the current
calibrated parameters files. The processing pipeline script, in turn, produces
several netCDF output files from your fully calibrated BRICK parameters. These
file names also include date-stamps. You will need to make sure the analysis and
plotting script points at the current files. You will also need to modify the
directory in which your plots will be saved.

./calibration/          R scripts related to the (pre-/post-)calibration of the
                        physical models, including reading data, likelihood
                        functions, and sub-model stand-alone calibration drivers
                        (some of these may be antiquated)
./data/                 data for radiative forcing (DOECLIM) and calibration
./fortran/              Fortran versions of all physical models are available,
                        and are wrapped in R calling functions in ./fortran/R/
./output_model/         physical model output (i.e., temperature, sea-level rise)
./output_calibration/   statistical model output (i.e., posterior parameter values)
./R/                    physical models in R
